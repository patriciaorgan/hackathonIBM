This project was created as part of a team of 6 people, We had a week where we learnt tips and tricks on creating a responsive and responsible website, we brought in design thinking to ensure the persona and the purpose of the site was kept on track and had no restrictions on what was to be created.

We came up with a Weather webApp that you can get flight information based on the number of days you want to travel for and the temperature at the destination as an average.

We used two API's one for weather and one from Saber for flight details
This was created in 2 day, but many ideas for enhancing this project was considered given more time.

We used Node.js for server side code doing the main computation, and some vanilla JavaScript to do some Client-side for the animation of the background changing with temperature slider.

Express, Node.js, Grunt, Bluemix, Travis, and CSS, HTML and SASS were used in the make of this webApp

As a result our time won first place out of 14 teams participating which was a great honor.
